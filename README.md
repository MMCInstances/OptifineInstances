# Optifine instances for MultiMC

## Disclaimer

**I no longer play Minecraft nor am I active in any Minecraft communities. Instances will be created on a per-issue basis. If a new version of OptiFine is released, please [create an issue](https://github.com/MMCInstances/OptifineInstances/issues/new) and I will update this repo ASAP.**

## Usage

### Installing a New Instance

To install a new instance, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/MMCInstances/OptifineInstances/releases) and select the optifine version you want to use. Download or copy the link to the zip for the version you want (e.g. 1.14.4.zip). You can then import the zip file in MultiMC to create an instance with OptiFine.

### Upgrading a Previous Instance

With each release since 1.14.4 F3 pre2, a patch zip will be included. This only includes the `mmc-pack.json`, `libraries` folder, and `patches` folder. You can download this zip file and extract it to your instance folder. Your instance's `.minecraft` folder, pack icon, and instance config will not be removed or changed.
